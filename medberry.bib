There were 8209 trainee attachments analysed, during which 618,695 sessions were undertaken by trainees. The number of supervised sessions per week that trainees worked varied considerably (median (IQR [range]) 2.6 (1.6–3.6 [0–10]) for all grades combined), with senior trainees more likely than junior trainees to be supervised for fewer than the three sessions per week mandated by the Royal College of Anaesthetists. The number of supervised sessions was unrelated to Trusts’ size, suggesting that trainees in smaller hospitals receive the same level of supervision as in larger teaching hospitals. Analysis of a dataset of this size should be a good reflection of the delivery of anaesthesia training in the UK.},

This audit examined the effects of a change from a partial to a full shift system on a cohort of trainee anaesthetists working in a large district general hospital in the South-west of England. Logbook and list analyses were performed for two 10-week periods: one before and one after the decrease in hours. An 18\% decrease in the number of cases done and an 11\% decrease in the number of weekly training lists were found for specialist registrars. A 22\% decrease in the number of cases done and a 14\% decrease in the number of weekly training lists were found for senior house officers. Furthermore, a decrease of one service list per specialist registrar per week was seen, which will have implications for consultant manpower requirements.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: American Society of Anesthesiologists-Physical Status scores (ASA-PS) and age were used to adjust for case-mix differences when evaluating surgical morbidity and resource use after total hip replacement (THR), transurethral prostatectomy (TURP), or cholecystectomy.
SUMMARY BACKGROUND DATA: Variations in complication rates or resource use among patients treated for a particular primary condition should be adjusted for coexistent disease. Age and ASA-PS scores are readily available and can be useful to stratify surgical patients for risk.
METHODS: One thousand ninety patients at five academic medical centers in California and Massachusetts who underwent THR, TURP, or cholecystectomy between 1985 and 1987 were studied. Data were obtained from medical records and a self-administered questionnaire to measure length of stay (LOS), postoperative complication rates, and follow-up physician visits. Data were analyzed with one- and two-way analysis of variance with the Bonferroni correction.
RESULTS: Increasing age and ASA-PS scores were associated significantly with increased LOS, complication rates, and frequency of post-discharge physician office visits. No interaction effect between age and ASA-PS scores was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Age and ASA-PS scores can predict postoperative morbidity, specific for each operation studied. Assessment of co-morbidity in surgical patients can be accomplished easily and with minimal expense. While remaining budget neutral, the distribution of reimbursements should be based on those preoperative risk factors that predict longer LOS and higher complication rates.},

All respondents kept logbooks, but 81\% and 69\% experienced problems recording subspecialty experience in Intensive Care and Pain, respectively. Less than 50\% regularly analysed their logbooks and for 67\% of Specialist Registrars, no (or minimal) attention was paid to the logbook at assessments.

  volume = {18},
  issn = {1743-9159},
  doi = {10.1016/j.ijsu.2015.04.079},
  abstract = {METHODS: The American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status classification system (ASA PS) is a method of characterizing patient operative risk on a scale of 1-5, where 1 is normal health and 5 is moribund. Every anesthesiologist is trained in this measure, and it is performed before every procedure in which a patient undergoes anesthesia. We measured the independent predictive value of ASA-PS for complications and mortality in the ACS-NSQIP database by multivariate regression. We conducted analogous regressions after standardizing ASA-PS to control for interprocedural variations in risk in the overall model and sub-analyses by surgical specialty and the most common procedures.
RESULTS: For 2,297,629 cases (2005-2012; median age 55, min = 16, max {$>$} 90 [90 and above are coded as 90+]), at increasing levels of ASA-PS (2-5), odds ratios (OR's) from 2.05 to 63.25 (complications, p {$<$} 0.001) and 5.77-2011.92 (mortality, p {$<$} 0.001) were observed, with non-overlapping 95\% confidence intervals. Standardization of ASA-PS (OR = 1.426 [per standard deviation above the mean ASA-PS per procedure], p {$<$} .001) and subgroup analyses yielded similar results.
DISCUSSION: ASA PS was not only found to be associated with increased morbidity and mortality, but independently predictive when controlling for other comorbidities. Even after standardization based on procedure type, increases in ASA predicted significant increases in complication rates for morbidity and mortality post-operatively.
CONCLUSIONS: ASA PS has strong, independent associations with post-operative medical complications and mortality across procedures. This capability, along with its simplicity, makes it a valuable prognostic metric.},

  abstract = {Long daytime and overnight shifts remain a major feature of working life for trainees in anaesthesia. Over the past 10 years, there has been an increase in awareness and understanding of the potential effects of fatigue on both the doctor and the patient. The Working Time Regulations (1998) implemented the European Working Time Directive into UK law, and in August 2009 it was applied to junior doctors, reducing the maximum hours worked from an average of 56 per week to 48. Despite this, there is evidence that problems with inadequate rest and fatigue persist. There is no official guidance regarding provision of a minimum standard of rest facilities for doctors in the National Health Service, and the way in which rest is achieved by trainee anaesthetists during their on-call shift depends on rota staffing and workload. We conducted a national survey to assess the incidence and effects of fatigue among the 3772 anaesthetists in training within the UK. We achieved a response rate of 59\% (2231/3772 responses), with data from 100\% of NHS trusts. Fatigue remains prevalent among junior anaesthetists, with reports that it has effects on physical health (73.6\% [95\%CI 71.8-75.5]), psychological wellbeing (71.2\% [69.2-73.1]) and personal relationships (67.9\% [65.9-70.0]). The most problematic factor remains night shift work, with many respondents commenting on the absence of breaks, inadequate rest facilities and 57.0\% (55.0-59.1) stating they had experienced an accident or near-miss when travelling home from night shifts. We discuss potential explanations for the results, and present a plan to address the issues raised by this survey, aiming to change the culture around fatigue for the better.},
